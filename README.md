# JSlantCorrector
## WeFax slant corrector app
This small Java app can help you to correct Wefax images. You can set the slant, and the position of the image. It has 2 types of denoise options.
- If you click the "Denoise" button, it will delete the isolated pixels (noise). There is a small Slider next to it. You can delete the noisy rows if you pull it down. When you delete a line, you can't get back, so please be patient, or reload the image! :) 
- After the resolution is good enough, press "Save" button! The default save name is filename_correct.png. If you keep this, then you can
delete the already processed original images. 
- The "Delete updated files" button will search the image files, which ones are already processed,
and will ask you to delete them.
